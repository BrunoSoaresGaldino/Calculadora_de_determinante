This program calculates the determinant of a nxn matrix.The used method to calculate the determinanant
is the Laplace's Theorem.

The input is given by a plain text file, see an example in examples directory. The output can be printed to the screen or
to a file.

Usage

    Type in command line: <determinante> <file_in>, to output on the screen or <determinante> <file_in>
 <file_out>, to output in a file.
